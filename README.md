# Simple_Caro

> A modern, extensible C++ library for Caro (Gomoku, Five in a Row) and its rule variants, designed for easy integration and clear OOP structure.

---

## âœ¨ Features

- **Flexible Board Management:** Easily configure board size and retrieve the current board state.
- **Rule Customization:** Switch between different rule sets (Tic Tac Toe, Four Block, Five Block, etc.) at runtime.
- **Turn-Based Logic:** Built-in management of player turns, move validation, and game state transitions.
- **Move History & Undo/Redo:** Track move history for each player and support undo/redo operations.
- **Clear API:** Intuitive and well-documented interface for all common game operations.

## ðŸš€ Installation

```bash
git clone <your_repo_url>
cd Simple_Caro
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
# Optional:
sudo make install
```

---

## ðŸ›  Usage
### 1. Create a new game
```cpp
    #include <simple_caro.hpp>
    Caro::Simple_Caro game;
```

### 2. Configure the game
Set board size and rule:
```cpp
    game.set_board_size(10, 10);
    game.set_rule(Caro::RULE_TYPE::FIVE_BLOCK_2);
```

### 3. Start the game
```cpp
    game.start(); // Default first turn is PLAYER1
    // Or specify which player goes first:
    game.start(Caro::GAME_STATE::PLAYER2_TURN);
```

*If you don't configure the game before calling start(), the game will start with default configuration.*

### 4. Make a move
```cpp
    game.player_move(Caro::PARTICIPANT::PLAYER1, {0, 0});
    game.player_move(Caro::PARTICIPANT::PLAYER2, {1, 1});
```

### 5. Undo/Redo
```cpp
    game.player_undo(Caro::PARTICIPANT::PLAYER1);
    game.player_redo(Caro::PARTICIPANT::PLAYER1);
```

### 6. Get board state and history
```cpp
    auto board = game.get_board();
    auto moves = game.get_moves_history(Caro::PARTICIPANT::PLAYER1);
    auto undones = game.get_undone_moves(Caro::PARTICIPANT::PLAYER1);
```

### 7. Check game state
```cpp
    if (game.is_over()) {
        auto state = game.get_state();
        // handle win/draw
    }
```
